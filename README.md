Need:

***Functions****
- Function to decide which way to shift blocks if necessary (we want to shift the fewest possible blocks and we need to have room)
- Function to shift blocks over by one space
- Function to go through slots and identify the proper location for a block to go

***Main***

- Intialize array of length 20 to Null or " "
- put the first block in slot 10 and then
- 19 times:  pick up a block from "the chute", find a proper space, make room if necessary, and finally, place the block


The Robot Challenge: Your robot will be judged by the fewest number of swapped blocks. To keep up with that number you will need to maintain a count of the number of times the Switch Blocks function is called. 

The Robot Challenge should be in mind when determining which slot a block should go in and which direction to shift blocks to minimize movement.
