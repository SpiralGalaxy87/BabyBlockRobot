# BabyBlockRobot

I love you!
OwO

Need:
- Function to decide which way to shift blocks if necessary (we want to shift the fewest possible blocks and we need to have room)
- Function to shift blocks over by one space
- Function to go through slots and identify the proper location for a block to go

- A Main program that puts the first block in slot 10 and then, 19 times, picks up a block from the chute, finds the proper space, makes room if necessary, and then places the block
