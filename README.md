I love you!

Need:

***Functions****
- Function to decide which way to shift blocks if necessary (we want to shift the fewest possible blocks and we need to have room)
- Function to shift blocks over by one space
- Function to go through slots and identify the proper location for a block to go

***Main***

- Intialize array of length 20 to Null or " "
- Put the first block in slot 10
- 19 times: pick up a block from "the chute", find a proper space, place the block, and shift other blocks down to make room if necessary

***Variables***
- A counter for the number of times the Switch Blocks function is called
- A tracker for the current robot position
- A tracker for the current block in the robot's hand


Remember: 
The Robot Challenge: Your robot will be judged by the fewest number of swapped blocks. To keep up with that number you will need to maintain a count of the number of times the Switch Blocks function is called.
